This story begins with a python conference. Not one that has happened yet, one that I am going to attend in May in Basel. I had the bright idea that I should not just attend, but also do a talk. I thought to myself
> "Jez, you only really do stuff if there is a deadline and you'd quite like to learn something new, you'd quite like to explore Amazon Alexa, what would you like to see on stage?"

So, I worked backwards. I knew how many people would be there, what the hall would be like, and what the atmosphere would be. Studious and interested. Not businessy. In need of a little livening up.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
15 Feb 2017: The Pitch
======================
Eleanor Roosevelt once said,
> "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”

It is this speaker's dream to appear on stage with an artificial intelligence helper. Amazon Alexa is opening up an exciting new world of voice-controlled user interfaces and maybe now the dream is possible.

In this talk the speaker will interview Alexa herself to show how python is the ideal language for programming the Echo, Dot or Tap speakers. You will learn how you could start. You will pick up a bit of AWS Lambda. You will have the opportunity to see technology break live on stage. Most of all, you will come away with enough knowledge about Amazon Alexa to understand its potential and its limitations.

Join us in making a dream come true and seeing if it is a thing of beauty...or a recipe for disaster.
