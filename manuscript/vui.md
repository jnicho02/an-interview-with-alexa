VUI has no affordance so you can't tell what it can do
VUI promises invisibility

Speech recognition (Alexa) is one thing. Natural Language Understanding is another

Jez: it feels a bit like Clippy

Not enough connectivity to other devices...e.g. doesn't turn on the XBox in the Living Room for you

Shazaam...shouty UI, upselling, etc. now you don't need to see that (Jez: but now
  they have no product, so no service)

VUI is no good at presenting choice

Fuzzyness....we aren't actually great at saying what we want. (Jez: English can
  be even worse)



  The Computer for the 21st Century - Mark Weiser
  "The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it."

  "The problem is that the initial intents are all stateless, so Alexa doesn't have a subset
  of intents depending in the previous question....for example, saying 'help' gets you the
  help menu and nothing else" - Danny Berzon

'Weizenbaum discovered something disturbing: people approached the bot as if it were a real, intelligent entity who was genuinely interested in their condition — even when they knew that it was a computer program. This condition is now referred to as the “Eliza Effect”'

"it appears that one of the final hurdles for AI is not, as Turing suggested, the ability to fool its human counterparts, it’s the ability to comprehend the information it is receiving and eventually empathize with others."

"At its core, deep learning teaches software to recognize complex patterns in sounds, images, and other data by feeding it large amounts of material and refining how it responds to the input"
