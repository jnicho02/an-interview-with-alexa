slot types
==========
Interactions are mapped onto intents

the full sentence can map to an intent that captures a variable from you and passes
it on. This is called a slot.

Slots an be built-in or custom.

Amazon have built in a whole load of speech recognition such as numbers, cities,
pop stars, etc.

Custom slots are for when it definitely won't be one of the built-ins.
You can provide examples of what the variable might be, for example airport FAA codes,
but it doesn't have to be every single possible answer.
